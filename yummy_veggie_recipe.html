        <h2>Description :</h2>
        <p>
            This veggie omelet is delicious served on top of toast. Use any cheese you like â€” Swiss and Gouda are both good choices.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients :</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoon butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 ounces shredded Swiss cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps :</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and bell pepper in butter until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a bowl, season with 1/4 teaspoon salt, and set aside.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Beat together eggs, milk, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a separate bowl.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over medium heat; swirl to coat the bottom of the skillet with butter. When butter is bubbly, pour in egg mixture and cook undisturbed until the bottom of eggs begin to set, about 1 minute. Gently lift the edges of omelet with a spatula to let any uncooked egg flow onto the skillet. Continue cooking until the center of omelet starts to look dry, 1 to 2 more minutes.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Sprinkle cheese over omelet, then spoon vegetable mixture over 1/2 of the omelet. Use a spatula to gently fold omelet over vegetables. Cook until cheese melts to desired consistency, about 1 minute. Slide omelet onto a plate. Cut in half and serve.</li>
